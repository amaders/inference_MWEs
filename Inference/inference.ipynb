      "- Stage 1 (piston moves quasi‑statistically, walls insulating): The process is reversible and adiabatic. For the gas inside the cylinder, dQ = 0 and the reversible adiabatic path gives dS_gas = 0. Thus no entropy is produced during this stage.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Stage 2 (the piston develops a tiny leak and gas flows to a reservoir at lower pressure): This is an open-system process with mass transfer across the boundary. It is driven by a finite pressure difference P_gas − P_reservoir > 0, so the mass transfer is inherently irreversible. For the gas inside the cylinder (the system), the fundamental relation for a simple compressible system with variable N reads\n",
      "  dU_gas = T_g dS_gas − P_g dV_gas + μ_g dN_gas.\n",
      "  During the leak the boundary movement is small, so to first approximation dV_gas ≈ 0 and dN_gas < 0 (mass leaves). Rewriting for the entropy change of the gas inside gives\n",
      "  dS_gas = [dU_gas − μ_g dN_gas] / T_gas.\n",
      "  The gas that leaves carries away energy (approximately the enthalpy per particle h_gas), so dU_gas is negative, and −μ_gas dN_gas is positive (since dN_gas < 0). The net effect is dS_gas > 0 for the leaking amount (any finite irreversible flow across a finite ΔP produces entropy).\n",
      "\n",
      "  At the same time, the released gas enters the reservoir (large, effectively at fixed T_res and P_res). The reservoir gains energy dU_res ≈ h_gas dN_leaked and its entropy increases by\n",
      "  dS_res = dU_res / T_res ≈ (h_gas dN_leaked) / T_res.\n",
      "  Since dN_leaked > 0 (the amount of gas entering the reservoir) and T_res > 0, we have dS_res > 0.\n",

      "- Total entropy change of the universe for the leak, ΔS_univ = ΔS_gas + ΔS_res, is the sum of two positive (or nonnegative) contributions and is strictly positive for any finite amount of gas transferred across a finite pressure difference. In other words, the irreversible leakage increases the entropy of the universe.\n",
      "\n",
      "Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "- The reversible, adiabatic piston motion by itself does not change the entropy. The subsequent tiny leak, because it is driven by a finite pressure difference and involves irreversible mass transfer into a reservoir at lower pressure, produces entropy. Therefore the entropy of the universe increases: ΔS_univ > 0.\n"
